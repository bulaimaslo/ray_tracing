# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Python Implementation)

This project is a Python implementation of the ray tracer described in the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

The purpose of this project is to explore the fundamentals of ray tracing and to fill some gaps in my knowledge of computer graphics, as these topics were not included in my data engineering university curriculum.

I am aware that Python is not typically the language of choice for performance-intensive tasks such as ray tracing. However, I plan to optimize the implementation using Apple's MLX library to compare the performance results between the native Python implementation and the optimized version.
